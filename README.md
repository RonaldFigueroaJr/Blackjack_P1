# HOW TO PLAY:
Welcome to a simplified version of BlackJack! Rules are simple, whoever is closest to "21" without going going over, known as "Busting", wins the game. What makes this game simplified? No casino rules! Basically a 50/50 win, it is a straight forward whoever has the most value closest to "21". Basic rules still apply, all card values shown are exact, while Jack,Queen, and King have a value of 10. Ace on the other hand, has a value of either 1, or 11, depending on the other cards in your hand. Press 'Hit' to start dealing cards to yourself, 'Stand' if you are finished and comfortable with your cards, and 'Deal' to reset the table and 'Restart' to clear the win/loss results.
